                <h2 class="page-title">HAPPY 2nd ANNIVERSARY MY LOVE❤❤</h2>
                <div class="page-content">
                     Heyyyyaaaa BHARGAVI ❤❤ <br><br> Finally!!!! Its been complete 2 years since we are together in an official relationship and I am really happy that we had the courage to come this far.

                    <br><br>
                    So let us now dive into a short story of ours and some of the special moments we have had together.

                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="page2" class="page">
                <h2 class="page-title">Welcome To Our Story</h2>
                <div class="page-content">
                    I am really sorriiiee that I won't be writing some much for you right now as there are many experiences that we can talk with each other and also it is your birthday month so I need to save some thoughts for that as well😝😝.
                    <br><br>
                    Yeahh so do you remember the day of 12th November 2023.... We knew that we are going to start our new journey on that day so we were waiting for our proposals to finish so we can enjoy holding hands. After so much time we finally got a chance to be alone on that day and I finally proposed you by giving a little gift to you on your right cheek. I hope you still remember it 😜😜. And that is how our journey began.

            <div id="page3" class="page">
                <h2 class="page-title">FEB 2024 and LDR</h2>
                <div class="page-content">
                    So now let's also remember February 2024 when for some reason our relationship was exposed in your house and your mother took actions for it as well😝😝.... It was a very memorable day as I actaully came to your house and we handle things before it becomes worse. But now that eveything is settled i am glad we were able to surpass this situation.
                    <br><br>
                    But as time passes new problems comes haunting to us.... Although we knew that we could end up in a LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP but it was a very sad moment for both of us as we knew it is going to be very tough but we actually were happy as we are going to experience some things. And that's how our LDR began.

            </div>

            <div id="page4" class="page">
                <h2 class="page-title">SPECIAL DATES</h2>
                <div class="page-content">
                   I agree at the starting phase of our LDR we faced many fights but we were able to surpass them as soon as possible. But we also were able to go on some fun little dates together like MARINES. It was an unexpected date as you came here for holidays and we planned it in very less time. We really enjoyed our time at Marines and we also have great pictures of that day. And this won't be the end of it as time passes by we are going to have even more and more fun yayyiieee😁😁.
                    <br><br>
                   Now let us memorize our double date with our friends. Yesss the day we went to Iskcon temple hehehehehe😁😁. I really had the best time with you at Iskcon temple as the GODS who resides there are our favourite and we really love them so much just like we love each other. It was also a very fun date and we even had some great pictures.

            <div id="page5" class="page">
                <h2 class="page-title">THE DESERT</h2>
                <div class="page-content">
                    Don't get confuse from the title as it reflects our current situation. Yeahh I know it is getting difficult to meet in recent days but i think we should not let ourselves down because of this dryness and should keep cheering each other with endless LOVE. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you so much for coming and also staying into my life as you make my life more bright.<br><br>
                    I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BHARGAVI❤❤
